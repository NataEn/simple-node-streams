// this is an example of the better way to read and write file content
// useing fs.createReadStream function we read and write the file content as a stream
// and thus loading the file content chunk by chunk
//this is much better because we use less memory on the server (becuase we don't waite for the whole
//file to dowload) and as soon as we get some data comming we send it off to the client
// chunk by chunk, so the lag time between recieving a request from the client and sending a response is
// smaller.

const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  //to send a file, uncomment this ti see how the file is being sent
  //const stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + "/files/longTextFile.txt");
  //   res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  //   stream.pipe(res);

  //When a client asks for that big file, we stream it one chunk at a time, which means we donâ€™t buffer it in memory at all.
